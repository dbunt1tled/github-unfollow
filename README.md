## Prerequisites

- Go 1.16 or higher
- A GitHub account
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with the `user:follow` scope

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-unfollow.git
   cd github-unfollow
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your GitHub credentials:
   ```
   GITHUB_USER=your_github_username
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   ```

## Usage

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o github-unfollow cmd/main.go
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./github-unfollow
   ```

3. The tool will:
   - Fetch your followers and following lists
   - Identify users who don't follow you back
   - Show you the list of users to be unfollowed
   - Ask for confirmation before proceeding (unless `-force` is used)
   - Process unfollows concurrently using the configured worker pool

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
# Required
GITHUB_USER=your_github_username
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token

# Optional (with defaults)
WORKER_COUNT=10  # Number of concurrent workers
QUEUE_SIZE=10     # Size of the worker queue
```

### Command-Line Flags

- `-force`: Skip the interactive confirmation prompt (use with caution)

Example:
```bash
# Run with default settings and interactive confirmation
./github-unfollow

# Run with force flag (skips confirmation)
./github-unfollow -force
```

## Security

- Your GitHub token is only used to authenticate with the GitHub API
- The token requires only the `user:follow` scope
- Never share your `.env` file or commit it to version control
